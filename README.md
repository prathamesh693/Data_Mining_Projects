# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Yield Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict crop yield based on temperature and pesticide usage. It includes preprocessing, regression modeling, and clustering evaluation.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Data_Preprocessing.py`: Cleans and transforms data.
- `Data_modeling.py`: Builds and trains ML models.
- `last_stage.py`: Evaluates models and prints results.
- `Crop_Yield_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
python Data_Preprocessing.py
python Data_modeling.py
python last_stage.py
